      "title": "Why we are using Bcrypt?",
      "summary": "Bcrypt is a hash algorithm designed to securely store user passwords. Derived from the Blowfish block cipher and used with a salt, it intentionally slows down hash computation through its cost factor, making brute-force attacks difficult and ensuring each hash is unique. This intentional slowness enhances password security by limiting how quickly an attacker can guess passwords.",

      "summary": "The ElGamal cryptosystem is a public-key encryption scheme built upon the mathematical foundation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Instead of merely establishing a shared secret, ElGamal enables both encryption and decryption operations. Its security relies on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem and the randomness of ephemeral keys.",

For nearly 300 years, it was considered unbreakable, standing as a symbol of cryptographic ingenuity before modern frequency analysis methods revealed its vulnerabilities.",

ECC also supports digital signatures and key exchange protocols, forming a backbone for secure communications.",
